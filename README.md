# Step 5: Migration to PostgreSQL Database

## Overview
This step represents a significant architectural improvement by migrating our application from the embedded H2 database to the robust PostgreSQL relational database management system. PostgreSQL provides better performance, scalability, and enterprise-level features compared to the in-memory H2 solution previously used.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Replaced H2 with PostgreSQL
The application has been updated to use PostgreSQL as its primary database engine. This change enhances data persistence, transactional integrity, and supports larger-scale deployments.

### 2. Updated `application.properties`
The configuration properties were modified to establish connections to the PostgreSQL database instance. New parameters include:
- Connection URL
- Username
- Password
- Driver class name

### 3. Integrated Flyway for Database Migrations
Flyway was incorporated to manage schema versions and apply incremental changes automatically upon application startup. This ensures smooth upgrades and rollbacks of database structures.

## Benefits Achieved
- Enhanced data durability and recovery capabilities
- Improved concurrency control and locking mechanisms
- Better support for complex queries and indexing strategies
- Streamlined database evolution through automated migrations

## Next Steps
Future enhancements could include:
- Adding SSL/TLS encryption for secure database communications
- Implementing connection pooling optimizations
- Exploring partitioning techniques for large datasets
- Integrating monitoring solutions for database health tracking

This transition marks a substantial milestone towards building a production-grade backend infrastructure capable of supporting growing demands efficiently.
