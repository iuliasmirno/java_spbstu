# README: Step 2 - Unit Testing

## Introduction
Welcome to Step 2 of our backend development process! In this stage, we've focused on writing comprehensive unit tests for our application components using JUnit. These tests ensure that individual units of our code work properly when isolated from other parts of the system.

## Test Coverage
We've created test cases for the following core components of our application:

### Controllers
- **NotificationControllerTest.java**
- **TaskControllerTest.java**
- **UserControllerTest.java**

These tests verify that our REST endpoints respond appropriately to different types of HTTP requests and return expected JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.

### Services
- **NotificationServiceImplTest.java**
- **TaskServiceImplTest.java**
- **UserServiceImplTest.java**

The service layer tests validate the correctness of our business logic, including task management, notification handling, and user-related operations.

### Repositories
- **InMemoryNotificationRepositoryTest.java**
- **InMemoryTaskRepositoryTest.java**
- **InMemoryUserRepositoryTest.java**
